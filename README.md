# quiz-for-dissertation

This is the quiz I'm developing for my dissertation project, "who lives in the most realistic social media bubble?". 

Essentially, the users are asked to predict the responses of the general public to questions previously asked in British social attitudes surveys. We can then compare the users
answers to the actual ones, and determine how much of a bubble some users are in on certain topics. The user will also be able to compare their answers to the actual ones upon 
completing the quiz. 

The quiz will be published on Amazon Mechanical Turk, so that users will be paid to complete the quiz. Data collected from this will be used for my dissertation and also future
research.
