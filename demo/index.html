            <p>The purpose of this survey and quiz is to collect data on how people’s opinions relate to their
               knowledge of other people’s opinions. We will use this data in ongoing academic research. The responses
                you provide will be anonymised and will not be possible to link to your identity. Responses may be made
                public in anonymous form.
            </p>
            <p>In order to claim payment from Mechanical Turk you are required to pay attention to, and complete
               all survey and quiz questions. You will later be shown correct answers to quiz questions, and
               your own score. Your score will not affect payment in any way. Payment is contingent only on
               completing the task and passing attention check(s).
             </p>
             <p>We hope you find the quiz fun and informative :-) </p>

             <ul>The researchers are:
               <li>Student: Regan Jones, Department of Computer Science & Informatics, Cardiff University. </li>
               <li>Supervisor: Crispin Cooper, Research Fellow, Sustainable Places Research Institute, Cardiff University.</li>
             </ul>

             <p>Should you have any questions, we are contactable via your Amazon Mechanical Turk dashboard. </p>
             <p>The survey includes questions of a sensitive nature, including personal opinions on sensitive
               topics, and protected characteristics such as your ethnic background.
             </p>
             <p>Your responses to all questions are stored in anonymous form only. </p>
             <p>While you are completing the survey, we will store a Human Interface Task Identifier (HIT ID)
               provided by Amazon. When you complete the survey as instructed, we return the HIT ID to Amazon
               to instruct them to pay you for your response. Amazon will store the HIT ID for their records,
               but it will not be possible for us or anyone else to link the HIT ID to your responses. This
               ensures your anonymity but also means your anonymous responses cannot be withdrawn once the
               task is complete.
             </p>
             <p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) the data controller is Cardiff University.
               We collect and retain your responses to serve our legitimate interests as a research
               organization.
             </p>
             <p>You may withdraw from the task at any time before you have completed it, by closing this
               browser window.
